A community for communities of linux desktop related projects, that tries to close the gap between people, providing a platform that focuses on progress and productivity.

## Why?

Projects related to the Linux desktop have various sized communities that coexist independent from each other, even though they share a lot of the same interests and domain. Interaction between maintainers and contributors of those communities does happen, but is limited and has no good platform.

## Benefits

A shared space for those communities makes it easier to:

 - get **valuable** feedback
 - meet **like minded** people
 - find contributors or projects to contribute to
 - get **domain specific** programming or design **help**


## Discord ([invite here](https://discord.gg/RqKTeA4uxW))

Discord offers a few very useful tools for a multi-community environment. That's why it currently is the main channel for the community.

### For Project maintainers and contributors

Maintainers of reasonably sized projects, get a `maintainer` role, which allows them to post and publish announcements, showcase and preview posts, and moderate users. There is no obligation to moderate, but you have the option if you want to.

> If you are able to maintain a project community, you are easily capable to moderate if necessary.

You can also create roles for your project or projects and assign them to contributors and users, to make your community easier to identify and manage.

## Future

This is a very early stage of the Desktop Makers community. And I want to do anything in my power to improve it. If you have any suggestions about how to improve the community, please just hit me up. Nothing is off the table.
