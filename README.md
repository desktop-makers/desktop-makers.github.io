A community for communities of linux desktop related projects, that tries to close the gap between people, providing a platform that focuses on progress and productivity.

## Why?

Projects related to the Linux desktop have various sized communities that coexist independent from each other, even though they share a lot of the same interests and domain. Interaction between maintainers and contributors of those communities does happen, but is limited and has no good platform.

## Benefits

A shared space for those communities makes it easier to:

 - get **valuable** feedback
 - meet **like minded** people
 - find contributors or projects to contribute to
 - get **domain specific** programming or design **help**
