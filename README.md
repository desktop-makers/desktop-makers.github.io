# Desktop Makers

A community for communities of linux desktop related projects.

## Why?

The open source linux desktop community has tons of projects with various sized communities. Those communities coexist independent from each other, even though they share a lot of the same interests.

A shared space for those communities makes it easier to:

 - meet like minded people
 - get valuable feedback
 - find contributors
 - get domain specific programming or design help
